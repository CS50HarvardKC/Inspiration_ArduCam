## Description:
All scripts in this folder have something to do with low-level control functionality.
These scripts are meant to methodically test the functionality of the ASV's software.

## Format:
It is especially important to document the testing files, as these files serve a potentially time-saving purpose. As such, please format code in the following manner:

```bash
"""
[Header line documentation:
 - Description of the code's intended purpose
 - Validation metrics (i.e. what makes the test successful]
"""

[Code and comments]
```

The additional validation metric documentation in the header allows users to quickly determine which aspects of the system (hardware and software) work accurately, and which are broken/not set up correctly.
