Here is what functions need to be in place:
- Based on two objects, find the midpoint between the two objects.
- Based on an object's dimensions on the screen, and given the known size of the object and focal length of the camera, 
find the lat, lon of the object. NOTE: Not sure if this file is the right place for this.
- Based on where obstacles are, calculate a path that utilizes straight lines in order to move to a given waypoint.
